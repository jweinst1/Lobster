# Lobster

*An expression-based, binary nesting language*

`Lobster` is a prototype of a nested programming language (Lisp-like), that can be evaluated as pure expressions. 
The advantage of `Lobster` is the speed and small size at which it can be embedded or used in other applications.

## Build

Run `$ make all` while in the directory and use the executable in `/bin`.
